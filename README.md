Paper Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Managing information technology security risk is challenging and relies heavily on the vulnerability assessment process within an organisation's vulnerability management strategy. The common vulnerability scoring system is the de facto for prioritising vulnerabilities during the vulnerability assessment process, but its reliance on an external threat context renders it unjustifiable for determining practical risk for vulnerabilities in a specific information system. Alternative methods, such as Tenableâ€™s vulnerability priority rating and the exploitability prediction scoring system, also fall short by only predicting vulnerability exploitability based on external data. This highlights an existing challenge attributed to the lack of a comprehensive method to determine the practical risk of a vulnerability during the vulnerability assessment process. This study proposes automated vulnerability exploitability tests (exploit-t) as a vulnerability risk assessment method to improve risk-based prioritisation based on internal exploitability threat intelligence. The study employs a design science research framework and experiments in a virtual network environment, which is a simulation that validates the proposed method. The proposed method produces a score code-named bukirwa_score, which is a risk score that indicates the practical risk of a vulnerability based on the severity of the vulnerability and the existing security controls and measures. Results show that the proposed vulnerability risk assessment method has the capability to reduce the number of high-priority vulnerabilities by providing a better assessment of their risk. The technique demonstrates improvements in vulnerability prioritisation and provides a more practical risk score and rating that are both explainable and justifiable.

The POC Lab setup consist of a number of nodes that you can see in the lab topology in the paper.

For installation of Ansible Tower a great follow along labs can be found at redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_automation/exercise2.0/
For the RHEL License subscription, RedHat provides developer subscription licenses that one can access on signup as a developer
https://developers.redhat.com/articles/faqs-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux?source=sso#general

For Tenable and Open VAS Installation, below guides for setup. 
- Tenable Nessus = https://docs.tenable.com/tenable-core/Nessus/Content/TenableCore/Deploy_VMware.htm you can have a eseential licenses for the POC, but for API integration for automation a prefessional license would be needed
- OpenVAS = https://www.acunetix.com/support/docs/wvs/installing-network-scanning/
- Window Vulnerable Machine = https://github.com/vulfilip/grouppvm 
- Kali Linux OVA = https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines
- Metaploitable Ubuntu Linux Machine = https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/ if you are installing the image in a vMWare vSphere environement, first deploy it in a Workstation envrionment and export it with comaptibility with vSphere ESXI
- For the virtual firewall, The checkpoint cloudguard virtual firewall with trail licenses was used to manage traffic rules and emulate enterprise level restrictions, can be downloaded here https://support.checkpoint.com/results/download/133471 with a login, just create a user account and you can download the software.
