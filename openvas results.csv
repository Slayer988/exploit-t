  Beginning as late as January 2017 and as early as June 2016, browser developers such as Microsoft and Google will begin warning users when visiting
  web sites that use SHA-1 signed Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates.

  NOTE: The script preference allows to set one or more custom SHA-1 fingerprints of CA certificates which are trusted by this routine. The fingerprints
  needs to be passed comma-separated and case-insensitive:

  Fingerprint1

  or

  fingerprint1, Fingerprint2","Check which hashing algorithm was used to sign the remote SSL/TLS certificate.
